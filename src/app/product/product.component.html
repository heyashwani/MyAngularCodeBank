<div class="jumbotron">
	<li>In sidebar we have two route ie. product 1 & product2. Both routes refers to a single component with some additional path(dynamic route) that is product component(current component).
		in this situation we face an issue ie when product component first time called, it's constructor gets call but second and all other time it's constructor does not called
		so we can not do our work every time.
		Note: Find out the solution in .ts file constructor.
	</li>
